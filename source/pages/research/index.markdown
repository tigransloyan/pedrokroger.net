﻿﻿Pedro Kroger has developed research in computer music and music theory. His main interests includes automatic analysis by computer, computational musicology, algorithmic composition, sound synthesis, user interfaces, artificial intelligence, pattern detection, music generation from statistical models, and spectral processing. Previous  research include the development of a [meta-language](http://media.pedrokroger.net/papers/csoundxml.pdf) [for sound synthesis in XML](http://media.pedrokroger.net/papers/csoundxml.pdf), a codification for musical examples, and a language for composition with tuning systems.

He has also developed [Rameau](http://github.com/kroger/rameau), a system for automatic harmonic analysis (written in Common Lisp) and now is developing a new [humdrum](http://humdrum.ccarh.org/) based [library for music analysis](http://github.com/kroger/aristoxenus) in Python.
