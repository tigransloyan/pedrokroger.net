This page lists a few course I teach. All courses are taught in Portuguese, so I won't put the Syllabus here, but feel free to contact me at [pedro.kroger@gmail.com](mailto:pedro.kroger@gmail.com) if you want more information.


## Undergraduate level:


I usually teach the entry level composition course. I enjoy working with fresh students and help then to achieve the next compositional level. I also teach the most advanced class in analysis, harmony and counterpoint (MUS013) with an emphasis on late 19th century repertory. Here is a list of the courses I usually teach:



	
  * MUS110 Musical composition I

	
  * MUS111 Musical composition II

	
  * MUS114 Musical composition V

	
  * MUS013 Literature and materials of music V

	
  * MATA56 Programming languages paradigms




## Graduate level:


I teach both master and PhD students with emphasis on composition and computer music. I teach how the students can use computer programming to learn and implement topics in music such as post-tonal theory and contour theory. Marcos de Silva's [contour program](http://genos.mus.br/villa-lobos/contour-module/) is an example of software developed in those courses.



	
  * MUS504 Computer music I

	
  * MUS505 Computer music II

	
  * MUS506 Computer music III

	
  * MUS524 Music composition seminar I

	
  * MUS525 Music composition seminar II

	
  * MUS504 Special studies




## Open (and free) courses:


Sometimes I'll give some non-credit courses that are open and free to the community. These are the courses I have given so far:



	
  * Introduction to Csound

	
  * Introduction to sound synthesis

	
  * Introduction to LaTeX
