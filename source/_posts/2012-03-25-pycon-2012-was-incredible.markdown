I attended the 2012 PyCon in Santa Clara were I presented the tutorial
[Making and understanding music with Python and a little bit of Math].
I think the tutorial went well, and I'm in the process of moving the
teaching library I used in the tutorial to it's own github
[repository] (with better code and documentation). My friends who are
computer scientists, engineers, and programmers are always asking me
to recommend books to learn more about music. The problem I have with
most books on music theory is that they present things without much
logic and precision. There's a good portion of music theory that is
very logical and can be described mathematically.  That was the
premise for my PyCon tutorial and the reason I decided to write
[Music for Geeks and Nerds]. I hope I'll finish it in the next couple
months, so if you have suggestions, please email me at
kroger@pedrokroger.net.

Back to PyCon, I had the best time at the conference. I used to live
in the Valley when I was a visiting scholar at Stanford and it was
very joyful to visit some friends in the area.

I want to participate more in the Python community, so I helped to TA
a tutorial. It was a good experience and I end up making some friends.
I wish I had volunteered more, but I refrained from doing it this year
because I wanted to focus on my tutorial and I was afraid to
overcommit. Next year I'll volunteer more, I promise ;-)

The conference was stellar, lots of good talks and in-the-hallway
conversations. The wifi just worked, the AV team is beyond awesome,
and everybody is just **nice**. Thanks to Jesse Noller and all who
made PyCon this great conference. Hope to see you all next year.
