  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a programmer, composer, teacher, writer, <a href="http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/80.03.MicropreneurManifesto">micropreneur</a>, and
    class clown who loves traveling and creating things.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not in front of the computer I can be found playing the
    violin, hiking, traveling, or ambushing my cat.
