I was commissioned to write two new compositions recently; one for four clarinets and the other for soprano and mixed ensemble. In this post I want to share the video of both premieres.

The first composition is called "Correnteza" (Portuguese for flow). It uses a folk song with this name and I tried to emulate this flowing nature:

The second composition, "Noite no Trapiche" (Night at the Cane sugar mill), is a homage to the Brazilian writer [Jorge Amado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Amado). The lyric is based on his novel [Captains of the Sands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captains_of_the_Sands).

It's been a while since my last composition. I've been busy teaching, researching, and programming, but it's sure good to be back as a composer ;-)
