This is a short cheat sheet for python 3.1. I wanted a quick reference
for the core language that was short (2 pages tops), beautiful, and
free. I found a few cheat sheets on the Internet, but they weren't
quite what I was looking for, so I made this one using LaTeX.

You can download the
[pdf](http://github.com/downloads/kroger/python-quick-ref/python-quick-ref.pdf)
or get the LaTeX source at
[github](http://github.com/kroger/python-quick-ref).

Please, let me know what you think in the comments; I'm always looking
for ideas to make it better.
