The are quite a bit of nice python videos on the web. In this post
I'll list some of them.

## PyCon

The videos from the 2009 and 2010
[python conference](http://pycon.org/) are available at
[blip](http://pycon.blip.tv/). I don't like the browser interface in
flash, though, so I prefer to browse the
[archives](http://pycon.blip.tv/posts?view=archive&nsfw=dc). A better
alternative is to check the
[talk list](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/talks/) at the PyCon
website since it has the videos and more information such as slides,
abstracts, and biographies.

<!-- more -->

These are a few talks I liked:

	
  * [Understanding the Python GIL](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/76/)
  * [PLY and PyParsing](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/139/)
  * [Optimizations And Micro-Optimizations In CPython](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/7/)
  * [Teaching compilers with python](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/134/)
  * [Writing Books using Python and Open Source Software](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/69/)
  * [New *and* Improved: Coming changes to unittest, the standard library test framework](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/138/)
  * [The Mighty Dictionary](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/12/)
  * [Unladen Swallow: fewer coconuts, faster Python](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/71/)
  * [Python Metaprogramming](http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/96/)


## Showmedo

Showmedo is a website with community produced screencasts for free and
open-source software. It has a good amount of python videos such as a
[series about python 3](http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=6WiUOGJBb),
some demonstrations of the super cool
[ipython shell](http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=CnluURUTV),
and even videos for
[beginners](http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=AzsZ2afN2).

## Google's Python Class

Google has a
[full series of lectures](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)
about python. If you are just starting to learn the language (or even
starting to learn how to program), go check these out!

## More advanced videos


Finally, these are a few more advanced videos and a must watch for any
python programmer:

	
  * [Python 3000](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6459339159268485356#). A talk by Guido himself.
  * [Advanced Python or Understanding Python](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_kZDvwofHY) is a very nice talk by Thomas Wouters.
  * [Slightly Advanced Python: Some Python Internals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23s9Wc3aWGY) by python Ã¼ber guru Alex Martelli

So, go watch those videos and don't forget to recommend nice python videos to us.
