As I [mentioned before](/2012/11/time-tracking-for-founders/), I could
not find a time tracking application for the Mac that worked on the
menubar and generated the reports I wanted. As any self-respecting
hacker, I scratched my itchy and developed my own app,
[Kala](http://144seconds.com/kala/).

<!-- more -->

Kālá is a Sanskrit word for time and a traditional Hindu unit of time
consisting of 144 seconds. Also, [144 seconds](http://144seconds.com)
is close to GTD's 2 minute rule, making the little type A guy inside
me happy.

I don't want to turn this blog into a late night commercial (but if
you call *now* you'll receive a spoon for free!) so I'll just
highlight a few of Kala's features and benefits (you can see more on
[Kala's page](http://144seconds.com/kala/)):

- Easily accessible on the menu bar
- Simple and easy to use
- Create tasks, projects and categories
- Stop and continue previous tasks
- Rename and delete tasks, projects and categories
- See how much time you are spending on billable and unbillable tasks

There are still a few bugs to fix and features to add, such as iCloud
support and invoice generation, but I am happy with the result so far.
I am also working on a version for the iPhone.

Kala is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/kala-time-tracker/id604849943).
