## Introduction

How many hours have you worked on your Minimum Viable Product in the past sixth months? How many hours have you worked on your lifestyle business this week? How long does it take you to write a report? I’m able to give reasonable answers to these questions because I’m pretty anal about tracking where I’m spending my time.
Hackers turned founders are good at web analytics; tracking visitors, funnel, etc. But I’m always amazed how poor many founders are at tracking where they are spending their time.

Of course it’s easy to full yourself thinking that working more hours means accomplishing more. Working 10 hours a week on something doesn’t necessarily means acomplishing double of working 5 hours a week. But it’s a valuable metric, and all things equal, working on something for n hours a week will, most of the time, put you farther ahead than not working at all. The time that I track is focused time. If I stop to read my email I stop the tracker.
Sometimes you need to make the time when you really want to do something.

All the usual disclaimers apply here; these are the things that work for me, you need to apply the ones that work you you.

## Answer Questions

I like to be able to answer the following questions:
	1.	How many hours it took me to finish project X?
	2.	How many hours to finish task T?
	3.	For how long I have been working on task W today?
	4.	How many hours have I worked on my startup this week?

## Advantages

There are many advantages to this bizzare behavior:

Focus. It’s a Zen kind of thing

Actionable advice (through analysis). It helps to make decisions.
This is taking to long, kill it (don’t spend too much time on something)
Do by not doing something else
Outsource sysadmin
Don’t waste time with technology (wiki -> gdocs -> scrivener)

Say no. I’m much better at predicting how long something is going to take. For instance, I know that it takes me around 15 hours to write a basic project proposal. So when someone ask me to write something I can say “I wish I could, but this is going to take about 10 to 15 hours and I need to work on project X instead”.

Motivation. “Yay, worked 20 hours on my startup this week”. 

## What I Need

There are many different type of programs to log time. Some concentrate on tracking the time of tasks, other on tracking billable hours and generating fancy billing reports. Following are the things I consider essential for myself. 
Before I switched to the Mac, I used to use a very nice Gnome applet called Hamster [link here]. Unfortunatelly I haven’t been able to find anything close to Hamster for Mac Os. I tried I few, used Toggl for a while but now it seems that I’ll write my own app.

Show on the menubar.
To me this is the most important feature. I like to be able to glance at the menubar and see what I’m supposed to be working and for how long I’ve been working. In the example below (using Hamster) you can see that I’m working on a task called “make examples” and I’ve been working on it for the past 27 minutes. You can configure Hamster to nag you from time to time with the task name (the black thing in the screenshot). Some will find this anoying, but it helps me to keep focused. You can, of course, disable it.

Pause and stop the timer. This one is self-explanatory (but a few applications don’t implement it). It’s good to have a global hotkey for these actions.

Input and edit past events. I like to be able to rename, change the duration and start time, and delete an entry. It’s also very useful to be able to input old entries, specially for tasks you’ve performed outside the computer. (Minco can’t do this, BTW).

Work offline. There are a good number of online apps to track time (I have even used one for a few months). The obvious advantage is that you can access them in different computers and operating systems. But since I work mainly from one computer, I prefer to use a program that works offline.

I don’t need any complicated organization thing, just Projects (such as “Write post ‘Time tracking for founders’), Tasks (such as “Write first draft”), and Categories (such as “Blog”).

Nice to have: ical integration

Quick statistics. One thing that I like about Hamster is that it shows some basic information on the main screen without the need to go to the separate reports window. Notice in the figure below the total time for a tag (Blog: 0.7h), the time for the current task (27 min), and yellow label with the name of the project.

Nice entry mode <nome of the task>@<category> and name of the project (auto completion)

I also use a digital timer I learn from Jim Collins.

## Manual vs. automatic

I think that automatic tracking programs such as RescueTime are great, but
One app has multiple uses. I can watch lectures on VLC and waiste time on VLC
No items by time
Don’t care about comparisson
Doesn’t answer the questions I care about

## Analysis

Is it reasonable to try to put 20+ hours on my startup if I’ve been working only 5 hours a week?


Optimal number of hours a day (3-1)

How long startup v. Day job
What is the general trend of the last weeks?

What was my most productive day? (Decided to avoid having meetings on the MPD, etc)

Mon: 51.05h
Thu: 40.34h
Sun: 36.69h
Tue: 36.10h
Fri: 23.30h
Wed: 19.65h
Sat: 17.59h

Track energy (waking up late vs early): decision to wakup early
Energy: first week: less than 10 hours
 second week 18 hours
