I'm a college professor living in Brazil. I teach music composition, computer music, and computer science. In this blog I share my ideas about programming, Python, and Lisp. If you want to get in touch with me, email me at [kroger@pedrokroger.net](mailto:kroger@pedrokroger.net) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/pedrokroger). When I'm not in front of the computer I can be found playing the violin, hiking, or ambushing my cat.

I'm the author of [Music for Geeks and Nerds](http://musicforgeeksandnerds.com).
